**Go ChainFlow**
*This project is under construction.*

Go ChainFlow is a lightweight Go-based tool for orchestrating microservices workflows using the Chain of Responsibility pattern. It allows dynamic configuration of service chains to handle different types of requests efficiently.

### Features

- **Dynamic Workflow Configuration:** Easily define and configure workflows for different endpoints or request types.
- **Chain of Responsibility:** Utilizes the Chain of Responsibility pattern for flexible and sequential execution of microservices.
- **Customizable and Extensible:** Adapt the tool to your needs by defining and integrating custom microservices easily.
- **Lightweight and Fast:** Designed for efficiency and minimal resource consumption.

## Developer Info
### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Go ChainFlow.git
   cd Go ChainFlow
   ```

2. **Configure Workflows:**
   Define your workflows dynamically from an external configuration.

3. **Run the Orchestrator:**
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

### Example Usage

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

// Define your custom microservices
type SecurityService struct{}

func (s *SecurityService) Execute(request *Request) error {
	// Security logic
	return nil
}

type LoggingService struct{}

func (l *LoggingService) Execute(request *Request) error {
	// Logging logic
	return nil
}

func main() {
	// Define and configure your workflow
	workflow := Workflow{
		"Security": new(SecurityService).Execute,
		"Logging":  new(LoggingService).Execute,
		// Add more services as needed
	}

	// Create the WorkflowEngine
	engine := WorkflowEngine{Workflow: workflow}

	// Use the engine to execute the chain of responsibility
	request := &Request{}
	if err := engine.Execute(request); err != nil {
		fmt.Println("Error:", err)
	}
}
```
